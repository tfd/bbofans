<h2>BBO Fans Core Belief</h2>

<p>BBO Fans is a club open for all nationalities, that means we also have TD's from the most various countries, each
  with their own cultural backgrounds and habits. A different culture does not make you better or worse,only different.
  Remember, we are all children of the same God and he made every person a single one with his own private character,
  habits, fingerprints, and so on. Lets just make fun and accept other people just as they are. We accept all people
  unless they do not accept these statements.</p>

<h2>Useful information about BBO Fans</h2>

<p>BBO Fans organizes 2 types of tourneys</p>

<ul>
  <li>ROCK around the CLOCK (ROCK)</li>
  <li>ROCK's best DANCERS (RBD)</li>
</ul>

<p>ROCK tourneys are free for everybody and we run a tourney every 4 hours (click on "ROCK around the clock enter site"
  button and then on "about us" for more information) while RBD we run 2 times a day</p>

<h2>Registration as new member</h2>

<p>When you register (by clicking on the green "Free Registration" button) you are only allowed to play in ROCK tourneys
  NOT in RBD. To become a member of RBD you must have played in ROCK at least 3 months, at least 12 tourneys and scored
  at least 50% or a medium of 2 awards points.</p>

<p>Every 3 months calculation is redone and, according above rules, members will be inserted in RBD and an equal number
  of members with bad results will be removed from RBD. Of course the removed members can still play in ROCK.</p>
